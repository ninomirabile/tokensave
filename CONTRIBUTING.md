# Contributing to tokensave

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aovestdipaperino/tokensave.git
cd tokensave
cargo build --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

Requires **Rust 1.95.0+** (edition 2021). The CI and release toolchain is pinned to **1.98.1**.

## Build and Artifact Lifecycle

Standard Cargo commands define the supported workflow:

```bash
cargo build --locked                     # debug development build
cargo test --workspace --locked          # locked workspace tests
cargo build --release --locked           # optimized release build
cargo install --path . --locked          # optimized locked install into ~/.cargo/bin
```

Development commands use the debug profile; installation uses only the
optimized release output. `target/debug` is never an installation input.

`.cargo/config.toml` sets `TOKENSAVE_SKIP_AGENT_MAINTENANCE=1` for every cargo
process, which keeps the test suite from touching your own agent configuration
(#575). Tests spawn the freshly built binary, whose version is ahead of
whatever you last installed, and that is the signal the silent agent resync
watches for. Unset it only if you are deliberately exercising that path, and
not against your real home directory.

## Feature Flags

tokensave supports more than 50 languages via feature flags (see the README for the full table):

| Feature | Languages |
|---------|-----------|
| `lite` (default subset) | Rust, Go, Java, Scala, TypeScript/JS, Python, C, C++, Kotlin, C#, Swift, Svelte, Astro |
| `medium` | +Dart, Pascal, PHP, Ruby (including ERB and Slim templates), Bash, Protobuf, PowerShell, Nix, VB.NET |
| `full` (default) | +ActionScript, Lua, Zig, Obj-C, Perl, Batch, Fortran, COBOL, the BASIC family, Dockerfile, shader languages (GLSL/WGSL/HLSL/Metal), CUDA/HIP, Markdown, R, SQL, Julia, Haskell, OCaml, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, F#, F*, Quint, TOML, Lean |

Build with fewer languages for faster compile times during development:

```bash
cargo build --locked --no-default-features --features lite
cargo test --locked --no-default-features --features lite
```

## Making Changes

1. **Fork and branch** from `master` for stable changes, `beta` for experimental features.
2. **Write tests.** Every extraction change should have a corresponding test in `tests/`. Follow the existing pattern: create a fixture in `tests/fixtures/` and assert on extracted nodes/edges.
3. **Run the full test suite** before submitting:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace --locked
   ```
4. **Format your code** with the standard Rust toolchain:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked
   ```

## Adding a New Language Extractor

1. Add a tree-sitter grammar dependency (or vendor it under `vendor/`).
2. Create `src/extraction/{lang}_extractor.rs` implementing the `Extractor` trait.
3. Register it in the `LanguageRegistry` with a feature flag (e.g., `lang-{name}`).
4. Add a fixture file `tests/fixtures/sample.{ext}` and a test file `tests/{lang}_extraction_test.rs`, then declare it as `mod {lang}_extraction_test;` in `tests/integration.rs` (test files are not auto-discovered; see [Test layout](#test-layout)).
5. Update the feature flag tables in `Cargo.toml` and this document.

## Running Specific Tests

```bash
# All tests for a specific language (a module of the shared integration binary)
cargo test --locked --test integration rust_extraction_test::

# A single test by name
cargo test --locked test_find_stale_files

# Only sync-related tests
cargo test --locked sync

# Faster local loop: only the 11 lite-tier languages (language tests for the
# other tiers are compiled out). CI still runs the full feature set.
cargo test-lite
```

### Test layout

All `tests/*.rs` files are modules of one test binary, `tests/integration.rs`, because every test binary statically links all tree-sitter grammars and SQLite: 180 separate binaries took hundreds of gigabytes of `target/`. `Cargo.toml` sets `autotests = false`, so a new test file must be declared as a `mod` in `tests/integration.rs`, and helpers are shared through `crate::common`.

Tests in the shared binary run concurrently with every other test file, so a test must not mutate process-global state: environment variables (`std::env::set_var`), the current directory, or the `tokensave::cancel` flag. Such a file gets its own `[[test]]` target in `Cargo.toml` instead, next to the existing isolated ones. A test that re-runs its own binary with `--exact` must pass the module-qualified name from `common::qualified_test_name(module_path!(), "...")`.

## Environment Variables

Tokensave-owned environment variables must start with `TOKENSAVE_`. Runtime Rust sources are checked by `tests/env_var_namespace_test.rs`; operating-system, Cargo, Git, and agent-owned variables require an explicit allowlist rationale. Use qualified environment APIs such as `std::env::var` so the policy check can identify accesses. Keep variable names as string literals at their access site unless a shared constant is required, and never print environment-variable values because some carry authentication material.

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit style:

```
fix: handle UTF-16 encoded files in sync
feat: add Dart annotation extraction
refactor: simplify reference resolver lookup
```

Keep the first line under 72 characters. Add a body explaining *why* if the change isn't obvious.

## Pull Requests

- Target `master` for bug fixes and stable features.
- Target `beta` for experimental or breaking changes.
