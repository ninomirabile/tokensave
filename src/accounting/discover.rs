//! Missed-opportunity analyzer over ingested Claude Code transcript turns.
//!
//! Scans the `turns` table and flags turns that consisted *only* of
//! file-navigation tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) — work a tokensave graph
//! query (`search`, `context`, `callers`, `callees`, `impact`, `outline`,
//! `read`, `node`) could have served far more cheaply. Results are bucketed by
//! the navigation tool that drove the turn, with a deliberately CONSERVATIVE
//! estimate of recoverable input tokens.
//!
//! # Estimation method and assumptions
//!
//! Per turn, the `turns` table records the comma-joined `tool_names` and — as
//! of #474 — `tool_result_tokens`, the measured size of the tool results that
//! turn's tools injected into the conversation. That is the quantity this
//! analyzer reports as **addressable**: the text a graph query could have
//! served instead.
//!
//! It is deliberately not `input_tokens`, which is what this read until #474.
//! Under prompt caching `input_tokens` is only the *uncached remainder* of the
//! prompt — a double-digit figure per turn, which is why the reported totals
//! were implausibly small and looked like a placeholder. Nor is it the whole
//! prompt with cache included: that is hundreds of thousands of tokens per
//! turn, most of them conversation the navigation did not cause, and a graph
//! query cannot recover any of it.
//!
//! Two limits remain, and we stay strictly within what the data supports:
//!
//! 1. Bash-based navigation (`grep`/`find`/`cat`/`rg`) cannot be detected here,
//!    because command text is not in the table. Those turns are simply not
//!    counted — this makes the analyzer a lower bound, never an over-claim.
//! 2. Turns parsed before #474 carry `tool_result_tokens = 0` and so contribute
//!    nothing to the addressable total. The figure is not recomputed for them:
//!    it comes from transcript lines the database does not keep, and re-reading
//!    every historical session would cost more than the metric is worth. A
//!    range extending back before the upgrade therefore under-reports, which
//!    keeps it a lower bound rather than a wrong number.
//!
//! A turn is "replaceable" only when *every* tool it used is a navigation tool;
//! a turn that also edits, runs Bash, delegates, etc. is left out entirely.
//! This keeps the count conservative and avoids attributing edit-turn cost to
//! navigation.

/// Conservative fraction of a navigation turn's injected tool results treated
/// as recoverable by a graph query.
///
/// The addressable figure is now the payload itself rather than a whole
/// prompt (#474), so the old rationale — that most of `input_tokens` was fixed
/// conversational overhead a graph query cannot shrink — no longer applies.
/// What remains true is that a graph query is not free: it returns a compact
/// slice where a `Read` returned a whole file, so it replaces most of the
/// payload rather than all of it. Half is claimed. This is still a stated
/// lower bound rather than a measured value; changing it only rescales the
/// recoverable column, and the addressable figure stands on its own.
